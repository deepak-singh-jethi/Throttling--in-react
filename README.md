# Throttling Example in React

This project demonstrates how to implement throttling in a React application using functional components and hooks.

## Description

Throttling is a technique used to limit the frequency of function calls. It ensures that a function is only executed at regular intervals, regardless of how frequently the event that triggers it occurs. This can be useful for optimizing performance and preventing excessive function calls.

In this application, we throttle the input event to update a value after a certain interval. The throttled value is updated only if the input event hasn't occurred for the specified duration (1 second in this case).

## Usage


```

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/deepak-singh-jethi/Throttling--in-react.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Throttling--in-react
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
5. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:5173] to view the application.

## Code Explanation

### Dependencies

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- useState: Hook for managing state in functional components.
- useRef: Hook for creating mutable references.

### App Component

- **useState**: Two state variables are defined:
  - `value`: Holds the current value of the input field.
  - `throttledValue`: Holds the throttled value that updates at regular intervals.
- **useRef**: A ref (`lastThrottleCallAt`) is used to store the timestamp of the last throttle call.
- **handleChange**: This function is called whenever the input value changes. It updates the `value` state and checks if the throttled value should be updated based on the elapsed time since the last call.

### JSX Structure

- **Input Field**: A text input field (`<input>`) that triggers the `handleChange` function on change.
- **Display Values**: Displays the original input value and the throttled value in separate paragraphs (`<p>`).
